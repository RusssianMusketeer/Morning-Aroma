        <p>Decaf is short for decaffeinated coffee. It's coffee from coffee beans that have had at least 97% of their caffeine removed. There are many ways to remove caffeine from coffee beans. ... Caffeine can also be removed using carbon dioxide or a charcoal filter â€” a method known as the Swiss Water Process.</p>
